# Overview

The scripts in this directory parse the various `.ly` files and
extract the `pgwtc-notes.csv` file from them.

While that file is already distributed in the `pgwtc` PostgreSQL
extension, we include these scripts here for reference.

# Quickstart

Issue `make` to build the `tmp/pgwtc-notes.csv` file from the 48
Lilypond source files.
